The other day I went to the park and I met my old friend, her name was Mary. I haven't seen her for years and I was very happy with this encounter. We decided to go for a walk together and later that day we wanted to see a movie at 5pm. However, an hour later, we meet another old friend of hers and it was also quite sudden. So, we changed our plans once again and decided to go to the restaurant that was across the street.
